# About this activity

In the previous activity, we learned how to 1) load R objects,
2) convert gene ids, and 3) manipulate and view data frames and matrices.
We will use these skills and learn new ones.

Every data set has its own unique personality, and whenever
I am confronted with a new one, I always do an unsupervised analysis
first to get to know it.  These initial analyses will oftentimes
reveal idiosyncracies in the data (such as *batch effects*) that may
confound the interpretation of the results.

Today, we will learn how to cluster gene expression data and visualize it
with heatmaps.  These are basic, yet powerful, tools that every
genomics researcher should have in their toolbox.  They can be used to
tease out the strongest signals in the data, which can tell you
something about the biology driving the disease.

# Loading the data

We will apply unsupervised methods to the TCGA (The Cancer Genome
Atlas) breast cancer data set.  We have already worked with this data
in previous models, so I'm not going to spend a lot of time
re-introducing you to it.  Let's load it in and start playing!


```{r}
# The data we are using is located in this directory
data_dir <- "/home/data"

# Load the gene expression and clinical data.
load(file.path(data_dir, "tcga_brca_expr_norm_df.RData"))
load(file.path(data_dir, "tcga_brca_clinical_df.RData"))
load(file.path(data_dir, "tcga_brca_cdr_clinical_df.RData"))

# Align the data so that all the samples are in the same order.
x1 <- names(brca_expr_norm_df)[2:ncol(brca_expr_norm_df)]
x2 <- brca_clinical_df[["bcr_patient_barcode"]]
x3 <- brca_cdr_clinical_df[["bcr_patient_barcode"]]
sample.names <- intersect(intersect(x1, x2), x3)
sample.names <- sort(sample.names)
if(is.null(sample.names)) stop("No common samples")
if(length(sample.names) < 1000) stop("low number of common samples")

I <- match(sample.names, names(brca_expr_norm_df))
brca_expr_norm_df <- brca_expr_norm_df[,c(1, I)]

I <- match(sample.names, brca_clinical_df[["bcr_patient_barcode"]])
brca_clinical_df <- brca_clinical_df[I,]

I <- match(sample.names, brca_cdr_clinical_df[["bcr_patient_barcode"]])
brca_cdr_clinical_df <- brca_cdr_clinical_df[I,]

```

For convenience, we'll pull out just the gene expression values from
the `brca_expr_norm_df` data frame.  It contains the gene names in the
first column, and the gene expression values in the following columns.
Let's pull out the gene expression values as a matrix, which works
with more mathematical operations.

```{r}
gene.name <- brca_expr_norm_df[,1]
X <- as.matrix(brca_expr_norm_df[,2:ncol(brca_expr_norm_df)])
```

From module 2 a couple of weeks ago, we saw that the gene expression
data has a long right tail.  We'll transform the data to a more
normal-ish by taking the log of each expression value [^log_2].

[^log_2]: Expression data is typically logged using base 2.  This
    makes it easy to look for 2-fold changes, which corresponds to a
    difference of 1 after logging.  A 2-fold change is commonly
    considered, as a very rough rule of thumb, to be big enough to be
    interesting.


```{r}
X.log <- log(X+1, 2)
print(X[1:5,1:5])
print(X.log[1:5,1:5])

mean.expr <- apply(X.log, 1, mean)
hist(mean.expr, breaks=100,
  main="Distribution of Log_2 Gene Expression Values",
  xlab="Mean Log_2 Expression")
```

The data isn't quite normally distributed (especially at the lower
range), but it is close enough for some exploratory analyses.  So
let's get started!

---

# Visualizing the data with heatmaps

Let's start by taking a look at what the data looks like using a
heatmap.  We won't be able to make a heatmap of the entire data
set â€” there are just too many genes.

Just to remind ourselves, let's see how big the data is.

```{r}
# Check the dimensions of `X.log`

dim(X.log)

```

To reduce the number of genes, we will try to select the *most
important* ones for an exploratory analysis.  There are many different
ways to do this, and your choice here can lead to profoundly different
views of the data.  One common approach to select genes in an unbiased
way is to find the ones with the *biggest differences* across the
samples, or in statistics language, the ones with the highest variance
[^gene_selection].  Here, we'll pull out the 500 genes with the
highest variance.


[^gene_selection]: Other unbiased approaches may use other statistical
    measures, such as selecting ones with highest mean expression,
    highest interquartile range, etc.  Or, you may choose
    knowledge-based approaches, for example, using genes known to be
    expressed in breast tissue, or deregulated in cancer, etc.


```{r}
NUM.GENES <- 500
v <- apply(X, 1, var)
O <- order(v, decreasing=TRUE)
X.log.sub <- X.log[O[1:NUM.GENES],]
```

Now let's draw the heatmap.  The first thing to know about heatmaps is
that the R heatmap function [^r_helps] plots the matrix from the
bottom-up (the last row in the matrix is plotted at the top), which is
the opposite of what I want.  I want the first row of the matrix to be
at the top of the heatmap.  Thus, I will first reverse the rows of the
matrix.

[^r_helps]: You can get help in R, for example, to see what each
    argument in the heatmap function does, by typing `?heatmap`.

Second, when I'm doing exploratory analysis, I'll often work with just
a subset of the data.  It makes things go faster, and the plots are
easier to interpret.  To pull out 10% of the samples, let's store in
the `I.sample` vector the indexes of every 10th sample.  We'll use
this subset for now, but for the final analysis, we'll certainly want
to use the whole data set.

```{r}
library("RColorBrewer")

I.sample <- seq(1, ncol(X), 10)
rev <- X.log.sub[nrow(X.log.sub):1, I.sample]

heatmap(
  rev, Rowv=NA, Colv=NA, scale="none", labRow="",
  labCol="", col=brewer.pal(10,"RdBu"), margins = c(1, 0))
```

Each row is a gene, and each column is a sample.  It doesn't quite
look right, though.  There are a bunch of horizontal stripes.  This
happens because some of the genes are expressed higher than others.
While this is interesting, what we really want to see are the patterns
of expression across the samples.  In other words, we want to know,
for each gene, whether it is higher in one group of samples versus the
other.  So we are more interested in the relative expression of the
genes, rather than the absolute expression.

To get the relative gene expression, we will first normalize each of
the genes.  A common way to do this is to change each gene such that
the mean expression is 0, and the variance is 1.  The gene expression
values normalized this way can be interpreted as *z-scores*, or the
number of standard deviations arount the mean.  The absolute gene
expression values will be changed, but the relative expression
(whether it is higher or lower in a particular sample) will be
preserved.

```{r}
X.norm <- t(scale(t(X.log.sub)))
```

And now, let's plot the normalized gene expression.  We'll limit the
values to a range of -2 and +2 standard deviations so that the
outliers do not skew the colors.

```{r}
rev <- X.norm[nrow(X.norm):1, I.sample]
rev <- pmax(pmin(rev, 2), -2)
heatmap(
   rev, Rowv=NA, Colv=NA, scale="none", labRow="",
  labCol="", col=brewer.pal(10,"RdBu"), zlim=c(-2, 2),
  margins = c(1, 0))
```

This heatmap reveals a lot of variation in the gene expression, but
it's hard to see the patterns here.  We can try to bring out the
structure by doing some *clustering*.

---

# Clustering the data

## Clustering reveals patterns in the data

Here, we will do *hierarchical agglomerative clustering* (or just
hierarchical clustering).  As we discussed before, there are a number
of distance metrics, or ways to calculate the distance between two
data points.  Some common ones that might be appropriate for gene
expression data are:

+ pearson
+ euclidean
+ manhattan
+ minkowski

You can get a description of them in R using:
```{r}
?dist
```

Also, for hierarchical clustering, there are different ways to
combine branches into a tree:

+ average
+ complete
+ single

See:
```{r}
?hclust
```

```{r}
dist.method <- "pearson"
clust.method <- "average"

rev <- X.norm[nrow(X.norm):1, I.sample]
if(dist.method == "pearson") {
  row.dist <- as.dist(1-cor(t(rev), method=dist.method))
  col.dist <- as.dist(1-cor(rev, method=dist.method))
} else {
  row.dist <- dist(rev, method=dist.method)
  col.dist <- dist(t(rev), method=dist.method)
}
rc <- hclust(row.dist, method=clust.method)
cc <- hclust(col.dist, method=clust.method)
```

Now, we will generate the clustered heatmaps.

```{r}
rev <- pmax(pmin(rev, 2), -2)
heatmap(
  rev, Rowv=as.dendrogram(rc), Colv=as.dendrogram(cc), scale="none",
  labRow="", labCol="", col=brewer.pal(10,"RdBu"), zlim=c(-2, 2),
  margins = c(1, 0))

```



## Clusters and the underlying biology

From this heatmap, we can see that the tumors split up into different
groups.  Is there any biological significance to these clusters?  Are
these groups only seen in the gene expression patterns, or is it
related to any known biology?

As you previously learned, breast cancer is split up into ER+ and ER-
tumors, depending on whether the tumor expresses high levels of
receptors for estrogen.  This is really important to know because it
tells you what's driving the disease, and also how to treat it.  To
see whether ER status is associated with these clusters, let's label
the samples with a `"+"` for ER+ breast cancers, and `"."` for negative.
We'll leave blank the tumors that are missing this information
[^check_order].

[^check_order]: The first few lines of this code are just checks to
    make sure the samples in the `brca_clinical_df` data frame,
    containing the ER status, are in the same order as the gene
    expression matrix.  If they aren't in the same order, the plot
    will be incorrect.  Since this is critically important, you MUST
    add code to check these things!

```{r}
clin <- brca_clinical_df[I.sample,]
if(!all(clin[["bcr_patient_barcode"]] == colnames(rev))) stop("unaligned")
if(!all(clin[["bcr_patient_barcode"]] == cc$labels)) stop("unaligned")

x <- clin[["breast_carcinoma_estrogen_receptor_status"]]
print(sort(unique(x)))
er <- rep("", length(x))
er[x == "Positive"] <- "+"
er[x == "Negative"] <- "."
print(sum(er == ""))

heatmap(
  rev, Rowv=as.dendrogram(rc), Colv=as.dendrogram(cc), scale="none",
  labRow="", labCol=er, col=brewer.pal(10,"RdBu"),
  zlim=c(-2, 2), margins = c(1, 0))

```

In this plot, I see about four clusters of samples (although we can
debate about this).  Three of them have a lot of ER+ tumors (marked by
the row of pluses on the bottom), while the fourth (on the very right)
is nearly all ER-.  It's not a perfect split, however.  Let's
calculate the p-value to determine the statistical significance.  I'm
not going to go through the statistics in detail, but briefly, we will
split these samples into 4 clusters.  Then, we will set up a 2-way
contingency table and calculate the statistical significance with a
chi-square test.

```{r}
NUM.CLUSTERS <- 4
if(!all(clin[["bcr_patient_barcode"]] == cc$labels)) stop("unaligned")
cluster <- cutree(cc, k=NUM.CLUSTERS)

outcome <- "breast_carcinoma_estrogen_receptor_status"
values <- sort(unique(clin[[outcome]]))
uniq.clust <- sort(unique(cluster))
counts <- matrix(0, nrow=length(values), ncol=length(uniq.clust))
row.names(counts) <- values
for(i in 1:length(values)) {
  for(j in 1:length(uniq.clust)) {
    I1 <- clin[[outcome]] == values[i]
    I2 <- cluster == uniq.clust[j]
    counts[i, j] <- sum(I1&I2)
  }
}
print(counts)
print(chisq.test(counts))
```

In fact, the association between ER status and cluster is
statistically significant [^chisq_warning].

[^chisq_warning]: You will get an alarming warning here that the 
      *Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect*.  This is 
      happening because some entries in the contingency table
      are small, and thus difficult to model accurately.
      We can ignore this warning for now.

# mini-DREAM Challenge

**QUESTION:** How does the choice of distance metric or clustering
method affect the association of ER status and the clusters?  What is
the best set of parameters (distance metric, clustering method, and
number of clusters) and p-value you can find?

To answer this question, you can re-run the code under the section
*Clustering reveals patterns in the data*.  You can try different
values for `my_dist.method`, including `pearson`, `euclidean`, or
`manhattan`.  For `my_clust.method`, you can try `average`, `complete`,
or `single`.  Run the chunks and see what the clustered heatmap looks
like.

```{r}
# Select and fill in the values you want to use for distance method and
# clustering method (refer to the values above)
my_dist.method <- ""
my_clust.method <- ""

# Don't worry about changing the code below! You can just adjust the two
# values above and then re-run the chunk when you want to see the updated
# heatmap and clustering results.
rev <- X.norm[nrow(X.norm):1, I.sample]
if(my_dist.method == "pearson") {
  row.dist <- as.dist(1-cor(t(rev), method=my_dist.method))
  col.dist <- as.dist(1-cor(rev, method=my_dist.method))
} else {
  row.dist <- dist(rev, method=my_dist.method)
  col.dist <- dist(t(rev), method=my_dist.method)
}
rc <- hclust(row.dist, method=my_clust.method)
cc <- hclust(col.dist, method=my_clust.method)

rev <- pmax(pmin(rev, 2), -2)
heatmap(
  rev, Rowv=as.dendrogram(rc), Colv=as.dendrogram(cc), scale="none",
  labRow="", labCol=er, col=brewer.pal(10,"RdBu"),
  zlim=c(-2, 2), margins = c(1, 0))
```

Finally, here's a chunk that calculates the p-value using a
chi-squared test.  In this chunk, you will need to change the
`my_NUM.CLUSTERS` parameter based on the number of clusters you wish to
break the samples into.  There's not a hard and fast rule for how to
choose this.  You can just look at the data to see how many you think
naturally falls out.

```{r}
# Select and fill in the value you want to use for number of clusters
my_NUM.CLUSTERS <- 4 

# Don't worry about changing the code below! You can just adjust the two
# value above and then re-run the chunk when you want to see the updated
# Chi-squared test results
if(!all(clin[["bcr_patient_barcode"]] == cc$labels)) stop("unaligned")
cluster <- cutree(cc, k=my_NUM.CLUSTERS)

outcome <- "breast_carcinoma_estrogen_receptor_status"
values <- sort(unique(clin[[outcome]]))
uniq.clust <- sort(unique(cluster))
counts <- matrix(0, nrow=length(values), ncol=length(uniq.clust))
row.names(counts) <- values
for(i in 1:length(values)) {
  for(j in 1:length(uniq.clust)) {
    I1 <- clin[[outcome]] == values[i]
    I2 <- cluster == uniq.clust[j]
    counts[i, j] <- sum(I1&I2)
  }
}
print(counts)
print(chisq.test(counts))
```


Please document your results below.

```{r}

my_distance_metric <- ""
my_cluster_method <- ""
my_num_clusters <- 0
my_p_value <- 1

# The most important take-away

The most important thing I would like you to take from this, is to
**always look at your data**.  As a computational scientist, it is
easy to become complacent and place an undue amount of faith in the
power of the formulas that we've spent so much time developing.
However, the methods are only as good as the underlying data, and
biology has a limitless ability to surprise.  So, don't fail to spend
time looking at your data.  What does the underlying distribution look
like?  Are there unexpected patterns in it that are difficult to
explain?  Unsupervised methods can help you to reveal confounding
factors (very frequent), or discover new biology (sometimes).

Have fun exploring your data!

# Bonus â€” Thought questions

1.  A significant problem in science is *overfitting the data*.  This
is a common phenomenon where a computational method may work really
well on the data set that it was developed on, but then doesn't work
as well (or at all) on other data sets.  This happens because
computational methods will pick up on both signals that are
reproducible biology as well as signals that are idiosyncrasies to a
particular data set (e.g. confounding factors, technical variation).
As a method that is calibrated on a specific data set (like we did
here), it will become more finely tuned to pick up on features unique
to this data set.  The magnitude of the problem depends on the
relative intensity of the biological signal to the noise.  When
developing computational methods, you should always be aware that
overfitting is occurring.  What steps can you take to mitigate the
problem, or at least measure how big of an issue it is?

2.  In your exploration of different distance metrics or clustering
methods, did you see the association with many different parameters,
or just a specific one?  Is the result robust?

3.  What is a p-value?  If a p-value cutoff of 5% means that there's a
5% chance that you would see this association randomly, how many
significant p-values would you expect to see if you did 100
experiments on random data (e.g. tested 100 clinical covariates,
tested 100 sets of parameters, etc.)?  About how many tests did you do
to answer the mini-DREAM Challenge?  What does this mean in terms of
the number of false positives you expect to see?

4.  Why might an ER+ tumor be clustered with ER- tumors based on gene
expression?

5.  Are there other clinical covariates that associate with your
clusters?  (To answer this question, you will need to do more
computational analysis to test each covariate in the annotation
files).  What are the p-values of their association?

6.  If another clinical covariate is correlated with ER status, what
does that mean biologically?  Which one causes the other?  Or could
they both be the result of another process?  How would you distinguish
these possibilities?

# Bonus - Activity

## t-SNE: T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding

Another method to look at the data is *t-SNE*.  This method has
recently become popular because it works well with single-cell data.
It is a way to organize high dimensional data (the tumor samples here
are high dimensional because each gene is a dimension) into low
dimensions (i.e., into a two-dimensional scatterplot) in a way that
best preserves the distances seen in high dimension.  While we're not
looking at single-cell data here, it works well on bulk expression
data too.

A t-SNE analysis has one (major) parameter that you must specify, the
*perplexity*.  It determines the size of the neighborhood the algorithm
uses when finding clusters.  The way to fit this parameter is just to
try different methods and see what the clustering looks like.  Usually
a good perplexity is within 2-50, and I've found that around 15-25
usually works well for single-cell expression data.  You can try
playing around with this to see how it affects the plot.

Let's see how we can use t-SNE to cluster the data set above.  We'll
use the entire data set here (rather than the 10% used above) since
high numbers of tumor samples are easy to visualize in a scatterplot.
We use Pearson correlations to find the distance between data points.

This should run for a minute or two.

```{r}
library(tsne)

PERPLEXITY <- 25
D <- as.dist(1-cor(X.norm, method="pearson"))
coords <- tsne(D, perplexity=PERPLEXITY, max_iter=200)
plot(coords[,1], coords[,2], pch=19, cex=0.75, xlab="", ylab="", axes=FALSE)
```


Here, each point is a tumor sample that is clustered according to
their gene expression profiles.  Let's see whether the t-SNE clusters
here are associated with ER status.  We'll color [^r_color] each point
according to the ER status.  ER+ will be red, and ER- will be blue.

[^r_color]: Colors in R are represented as strings in the format
    `#RRGGBB`, where RR is a two digit hexadecimal value from 00-FF
    indicating the shade of red (00 is no red, and FF is the most).
    Green and blue shades are indicated in the GG and BB characters.
    As an example, `#D80713` is a red-ish color.  There is a heavy red
    shade (D8), while green (07) and blue (13) are low.

```{r}
clin.tsne <- brca_clinical_df
if(!all(clin.tsne[["bcr_patient_barcode"]] == colnames(X.norm))) stop("unaligned")

x <- clin.tsne[["breast_carcinoma_estrogen_receptor_status"]]
col <- rep("#A0A0A0", length(x))
col[x == "Positive"] <- "#D80713"   # Red
col[x == "Negative"] <- "#3979A8"   # Blue
if(length(col) != nrow(coords)) stop("misaligned")

plot(coords[,1], coords[,2], pch=19, cex=0.75, xlab="", ylab="",
     axes=FALSE, col=col)
```

You can see that the ER positive (red) and negative (blue) tumors are
separated relatively cleanly.  Thus, the ER status is a signal that is
robust across at least two different methods of clustering.
