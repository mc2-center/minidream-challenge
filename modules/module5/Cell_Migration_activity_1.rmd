### The goal of activity

The goal of this activity is to computationally model a cellular behavior staring from physical and chemical principles. In this activity, we'll simulate a **motor-clutch system** for cell traction dynamics as described by Chan & Odde, Science, 2008.

### Cancer cell migration and metastasis
Cancer progression involves the dysregulation of cell division and cell migration. If malignant cells were capable only of proliferating and not migrating, then the resulting tumor would remain a local disease. Malignant tumors are so deadly because hyper-proliferative cells migrate away from the tumor mass and invade the surrounding tissue, often metastasizing to distant organs. 
Thus, *cell migration becomes a key driver of progression*.

### Mechanisms of cell migration

#cell migration on 2D substrate
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_dir,"migration.gif"))
```

#F-actin retrograde flow
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_dir,"F-actin_flow.gif"))
```

#F-actin flow and traction force
```{r}

```
#cell migration mechanism
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_dir,"migration_mechanism.png"))
```
In a typical cell migration cycle, the first step is the extension of a cell protrusion at the leading edge driven by **actin polymerization** into self-assembled actin filaments (**F-actin**). F-actin undergoes retrograde flow driven by **myosin II (motor)**-mediated contraction, leading to protrusion retraction. At the same time, F-actin binds and stretches cell adhesion molecules **clutch** linking to the extracellular environment. The adhesion proteins can form focal adhesions that allow the cell to transmit traction forces onto compliant substrates. This system is known as the motor-clutch mechanism and is widely-used to describe cell migration (Mitchison & Kirschner, Neuron, 1988, Lauffenburger & Horwitz, Cell, 1996). Beyond single protrusions, the cell nucleates multiple protrusions via F-actin polymerization, each of which can be modeled as a motor-clutch system, with traction forces balancing across the different protrusions. Stochastic perturbations to the force balance due to adhesion bond rupture enable larger scale cell movements and can define the front and the rear of the cell (Vicente-Manzanares et al., Nat Rev Mol Cell Bio, 2009, Gardel et al., Ann Rev Cell and Dev Bio, 2010).

### stochastic modeling of clutch dynamics

# probability equation for chemical reaction

Clutch binding is a chemical reaction and can be simulated.

For a single clutch, the reaction scheme is
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_dir,"eq_reaction.png"))
```
where A is the unbound clutch, B is bound clutch.

According to the mas action law,
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_dir,"eq_mass_action.png"))
```
, and the results of the differential equation is
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_dir,"eq_reaction_B.png"))
```
We can also consider a Markov process which is any stochastic process without memory (Keener, Mathematical Physiology, 2009),
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_dir,"eq_probability_Markov.png"))
```
For the chemical reaction above, we can write the probability equation,
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_dir,"eq_probability.png"))
```
, it can be written in a differential equation,
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_dir,"eq_probability_DE.png"))
```
, and we can derive a similar exponential function,
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_dir,"eq_probability_B.png"))
```
In a numerical simulation, then the random number is smaller than P(B), the reaction is moving forward,
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_dir,"eq_probability_RN.png"))
```

# Exercise 1: clutch dynamics

With multiple clutches, we use 2D arrays to keep track of the individual states, so now `clutchState`, `csArray` and `timeArray` are matrices. 

For each time step:
1. Check the current state of the clutch, bound or unbound.
2. Determine the probability the clutch changes state. 
3. Execute based on random number generation.
4. Record the elapsed time.
5. Record the clutch state at the current time point.

```{r}
# Assign parameters
clutchNum <- 75     
kon <- 1       # s^-1
koff <- 0.5    # s^-1

timeStep <- 0.01      # seconds
numSteps <- 1000;

# main code

clutchState <- matrix(0,clutchNum,1)     # 0 for unbound, 1 for bound
csArray <- matrix(0,numSteps,1)          # clutch bound array
timeArray <- matrix(0,numSteps,1)        # elapsed time

for (i in 2:numSteps) {                  # Define simulation space
  for (j in 1:clutchNum) {               # Loop through each clutch
    if (clutchState[j] == 0) {             # If clutch is unbound
      pBind = 1 -exp(-kon*timeStep)   # Equation 2
      temp <- runif(1)                     # Random number generation
      if (temp <= pBind) {                 # Does event occur?
        clutchState[j] <- 1 }              # If so, clutch is bound
    }
    if (clutchState[j] == 1) {               # If clutch is bound
      pUnbind <- 1 -exp(-koff*timeStep) # Equation 2
      temp <- runif(1)                       # Random number generation
      if (temp <= pUnbind) {                 # Does event occur?
        clutchState[j] <- 0 }                # If so, clutch is unbound
    }
  }
  timeArray[i] <- timeArray[i-1]+timeStep  # Record current time
  csArray[i]<-sum(clutchState)             # record number of bound clutches
}

plot(timeArray,csArray,type="l", ylim=c(0,max(csArray)),xlab="Time (sec)",ylab="Number of bound clutches",col="blue")

clutchbCalc = (kon*clutchNum/(kon+koff))-(kon*clutchNum/(kon+koff))*exp(-1*(kon+koff)*timeArray)
lines(timeArray, clutchbCalc, col="red",lty=1)
```

**Challenge Questions**

What is the equilibrium bound clutch number (nc_bound_final)? 

What is the half time of this reaction (nc_bound(time_half) = 0.5*nc_bound_final)?

**thinking more about the exercise**
What do you observe? 

How will kon, koff, clutchNum affect simulation results?

### F-actin binding and stretching clutches
# F-actin flow stretches clutch proteins
With a constant F-actin flow, when F-actin binds to clutches, F-actin can stretch the clutches and generate clutch forces. For small extensions, the force-extension relationship of macromolecules and proteins is reasonably approximated by a spring (Mark, Polymers, 2007, Haber and Wirtz, Rev Sci Instr, 2000)

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_dir,"clutch_force.png"))
```
, and it exhibits a linear relationship under lower load. We can use the simple spring to describe the relation,
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_dir,"clutch_eq.png"))
```

In statistical mechanics, Boltzmannâ€™s law states that if a particle or system is in thermal equilibrium, then the probability of being in state i that has energy Ui is given by, 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_dir,"eq_boltzmann.png"))
```
Here we use the similar descripsion for koff,
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_dir,"eq_koff.png"))
```

# Exercise 2: F-actin flow stretching clutches

Now that we have code for simulating the dynamics of multiple clutches, we can bind clutches to F-actin and stretch the clutches due to F-actin flow.

**simulation**
For each time step, 

1. stretch bond clutches using constant F-actin flow
2. calculate clutch forces
3. calculate clutch bond and unbound probability
4. bond and unbond the clutches

Now simulate!
```{r}
# parameters
clutchNum <- 75     
kon <- 1       # s^-1
koff <- 0.1    # s^-1
clutchK <- 5       # pN/nm
bondForce <- 2      # pN
actinFlow <- 120

timeStep = 0.01      # seconds
numSteps = 100;

# Initialize
clutchState <- matrix(0,clutchNum,1)
clutchdx <- matrix(0,clutchNum,1)
clutchF <- matrix(0,clutchNum,1)
moduleF <- 0
timeArray <- matrix(0,numSteps,1)
csArray <- matrix(0,numSteps,1)
FArray <- matrix(0,numSteps,1)

# The first part of this chunk is the same as before
for (i in 2:numSteps) {

    for (j in 1:clutchNum) {
    
    if (clutchState[j] == 0) {
      pBind = 1 -exp(-kon*timeStep)
      temp <- runif(1)
      if (temp <= pBind) {
        clutchState[j] <- 1 }
    }
    if (clutchState[j] == 1) {
      pUnbind <- 1 -exp(-koff*exp(clutchF[j]/bondForce)*timeStep)
      temp <- runif(1)
      if (temp <= pUnbind) {
        clutchState[j] <- 0 
        clutchdx[j] <- 0;
      }
    }
    if (clutchState[j] == 1) {   # if clutch is bound
      clutchdx[j] <- clutchdx[j] + actinFlow*timeStep   # clutch stretched by flow
    }
  }
  
  engNum = sum(clutchState)

  moduleF = 0
  for (j in 1:clutchNum) {
      clutchF[j] = clutchK*abs(clutchdx[j])
      moduleF = moduleF + clutchF[j]
  }
  
  timeArray[i] = timeArray[i-1] + timeStep
  csArray[i]=engNum     
  FArray[i]=moduleF
}

plot(timeArray,csArray,type="l",xlim=c(0,max(timeArray)), ylim=c(0,max(csArray)+2),xlab="Time (sec)",ylab="Number of bound clutches",col="blue")

plot(timeArray,FArray,type="l",xlim=c(0,max(timeArray)), ylim=c(0,max(FArray)+2),xlab="Time (sec)",ylab="module force",col="blue")

```
